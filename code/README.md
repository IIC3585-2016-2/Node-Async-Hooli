First download dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then create the files needed for some of the scripts:

```bash
./create_files.sh
```

Then run any of the scripts with:

```bash
node some-script.js
```

Modify the functions called at the end of each script in order to alternate between using async and promises.
